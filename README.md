# Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript

---

I wrote this so I can use it in my trainings. I'm putting it up in gitbook but I don't want to call it a book yet. This was written for those who are completely unfamiliar with the concepts involved in creating web pages.

This "book"...

* introduces the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* shows actual code examples
* provides good online references
* gives some exercises
