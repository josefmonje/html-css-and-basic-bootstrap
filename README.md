# Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript

---

I wrote this so I consistent materials for my trainings. This way, I can also improve it and I also don't have to make one everytime or bring anything with me, for that matter. I'm putting it up on gitbook but I don't want to call it a book yet. 

This was written for those who are completely unfamiliar with the concepts involved in creating web pages. It's made to be as succinct as possible. For a complete reference of each:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=CSS)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
* [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/)

This "book"...

* Introduces the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Helps to learn commonly used libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery
* Shows actual code examples
* Provides good online references
* Gives some challenging exercises
