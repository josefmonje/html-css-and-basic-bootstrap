# Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript

---

I wrote this so I have materials for my trainings. This way, I can continuously improve it and I also don't have to make one everytime or bring anything, for that matter. I'm putting it up on gitbook but I don't want to call it a book yet. 
This was written for those who are completely unfamiliar with the concepts involved in creating web pages.

This "book"...

* introduces the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* shows actual code examples
* provides good online references
* gives some exercises
