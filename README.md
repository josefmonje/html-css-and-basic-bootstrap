# Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript


I wrote this as material for my trainings. This way, I can also continuously improve it and I also don't have to make one everytime or bring anything with me, for that matter. I'm putting it up on gitbook but I can't to call it a book yet. 

This was written for those who are completely unfamiliar with the concepts involved in creating web pages. It's made to be as succinct as possible. If you're looking for a complete reference for each topic:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=CSS)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
* [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/)

This "book"...

* Introduces the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Helps to learn commonly used libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery
* Shows actual code examples
* Provides good online references
* Gives some challenging exercises
