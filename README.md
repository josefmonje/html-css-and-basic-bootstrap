# HTML, CSS, and Basic Bootstrap


I wrote this to consolidate my materials for my trainings. I'm putting it up on gitbook but I can't to call it a book yet. This way, I can continuously improve it together with my readers and it makes it convenient for me to just refer to.

This "book"...

* Introduces the concepts of HTML and CSS
* Learn the popular front-end framework Bootstrap
* Shows actual code examples
* Gives some challenging exercises
* Provides good online references

This was written for those who are completely unfamiliar with the things involved in creating web pages. I will not be covering Computer Science topics. It's made to be as succinct as possible. If you're looking for a complete reference for each topic, the recommended places for each are:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=CSS)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)

Before reading, there are a few simple requirements. You must know how to:

* Search for stuff online
* Use a text editor

If this is something you're really pursuing, you'll seriously be doing a lot of searching. An error? How to do something? You'll likely end up in [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) a lot.

It helps to have a good editor with autocompletion. I personally prefer [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

While reading, the process will include:

* Introducing the idea
* Showing some code
* Doing some exercise
* Providing references online for further research

I not only encourage you, I compel you to interact with the examples and do the exercises!

After reading, you're expected to be able to:

* Understand soure codes of webpages
* Create and modify HTML and CSS to a certain extent
* Find solutions on your own
