# Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript


I wrote this to consolidate my materials in my trainings. This way, I can also continuously improve it and I also don't have to bring anything with me. I'm putting it up on gitbook but I can't to call it a book yet. 

This was written for those who are completely unfamiliar with the concepts involved in creating web pages. It's made to be as succinct as possible. If you're looking for a complete reference for each topic, the recommended places for each are:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=CSS)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
* [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/)

This "book"...

* Introduces the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Helps to learn commonly used libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery
* Shows actual code examples
* Provides good online references
* Gives some challenging exercises
