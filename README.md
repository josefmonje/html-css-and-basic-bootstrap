# Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript


I wrote this to consolidate my materials for my trainings. I'm putting it up on gitbook but I can't to call it a book yet. This way, I can continuously improve it together with my readers and it makes it convenient for me to just refer to.

This "book"...

* Introduces the concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Helps to learn commonly used libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery
* Shows actual code examples
* Gives some challenging exercises
* Provides good online references

This was written for those who are completely unfamiliar with the things involved in creating web pages. I will not be covering Computer Science topics. It's made to be as succinct as possible. If you're looking for a complete reference for each topic, the recommended places for each are:

* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=HTML)
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=CSS)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript)
* [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/)

Before reading, there are a few simple requirements. You must know how to:

* Search for stuff online
* Use a text editor

While reading, the process will include:

* Introducing the idea
* Showing some code
* Doing some exercise
* Providing references online for further research

After reading, you're expected to be able to:

* Understand soure codes of webpages
* Create and modify HTML, CSS and JS to a certain extent
* Find solutions on your own
